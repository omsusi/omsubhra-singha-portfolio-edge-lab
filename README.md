# 🛰️ OMSUBHRA_SINGHA // PORTFOLIO_V1.0

**An Industrial-Grade, Edge-Optimized System built with Next.js 15, Cloudflare, and AI-Orchestrated Workflows.**

## 🌐 Connectivity & Signal Routing

* **Primary Engine (Edge):** [omsubhra-singha.pages.dev](https://omsubhra-singha.pages.dev)
* **LinkedIn Proxy Node:** [https://github.com/omsusi/portfolio-bridge](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/omsusi/portfolio-bridge)

### 🔗 Social Handshake Optimization

To bypass restrictive "Malicious Link" filters on professional networks like LinkedIn, this system utilizes a **Redirect Proxy Protocol**:

* **Signal Masking**: A lightweight **GitHub Pages** instance acts as a trusted entry point.
* **Automatic Handover**: A meta-refresh and JS-based redirection layer instantly hand off the visitor from the GitHub domain to the high-performance **Cloudflare Pages** endpoint.
* **Trust Continuity**: This method leverages GitHub's high domain authority to ensure 100% link deliverability and high-fidelity social previews in LinkedIn feeds.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a **Modular Sector Architecture**, separating the "Kernel" logic from the "UI Sectors" to ensure a 100% dry and maintainable codebase.

### 📂 File Hierarchy (The "Industrial Blueprint")

* **`/src/kernel`**: Core logic providers—handles global state for Protocol sensing and Motion orchestration.
* **`/src/sectors`**: Domain-specific UI blocks (Hero, Experience, Stack)—built as autonomous "black boxes" that don't leak styles.
* **`/src/orbit`**: Interactive modal systems and card overlays that exist outside the main document flow.
* **`/src/api`**: Edge-runtime functions for telemetry and handshake logic.
* **`/config`**: The **"System BIOS"**—a centralized JSON-based data layer. Updating the resume is as simple as editing a single config file.

## 🏗️ Architectural Justification: Why "Edge-Optimized"?

In Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), performance is measured by **Signal Integrity** and **Latency**. This laboratory was architected to mirror those principles in a software environment.

### 1. Distributed Logic (V8 Isolates vs. Cold Starts)

Traditional cloud hosting relies on Virtual Machines or Containers that suffer from "Cold Starts"—a delay in signal processing when a server wakes up.

* **The Solution**: By deploying on the **Cloudflare Edge**, the system utilizes **V8 Isolates**. These are lightweight execution contexts that initialize in milliseconds, ensuring the "Laboratory" is live before the user's browser even finishes its first DNS handshake.
* **Global Synchronization**: Logic is executed at the data center closest to the user (300+ global nodes), ensuring that a visitor in Malda and a recruiter in San Francisco experience the same <20ms latency.

### 2. Middleware Telemetry (Zero-Invasive Handshaking)

Most analytics systems rely on heavy client-side scripts that bloat the main thread. This system moves that logic to the **Network Edge**.

* **Intercept at the Edge**: The **Visitor Counter** logic runs in the "Middleware" layer. It intercepts the request, performs a cryptographic ETag/Cookie handshake, and updates the **Upstash Redis** global state before the HTML is even served to the user.
* **Impact**: This results in zero "Hydration Lag" on the client side, keeping the UI responsive and the telemetry accurate.

### 3. Resource-Constraint Engineering (SVG & Protocol Sensing)

Modern web design is often "over-specced," using heavy 3D libraries that drain mobile hardware resources. This system treats the browser like an embedded system with limited power.

* **The SVG-Native Approach**: By using code-based vectors instead of rasterized images, we reduce the **Payload-to-Fidelity ratio**. The site achieves high visual density with a fraction of the bandwidth.
* **Hardware Protocol Sensing**: The **EMERGENCY protocol** is a direct nod to low-power engineering. It strips the CSSOM to its bare essentials, providing a high-contrast monochromatic interface optimized for maximum readability on low-power displays or high-glare environments.

---

## 🛡️ Protocol Sensing (Adaptive Logic Control)

Moving beyond binary Light/Dark modes, this system implements **Hardware Protocol Sensing**. The site alters its visual and logic state based on user-selected protocols:

* **SUB_ZERO**: High-focus, low-distraction environment.
* **OVERDRIVE**: Maximum signal fidelity and interactive density.
* **EMERGENCY**: A monochromatic, high-contrast, low-power mode designed for low-bandwidth and high-efficiency hardware environments.

## 📊 Telemetry & Handshake Logic (The "Secret Sauce")

The system maintains a lightweight, privacy-focused **Edge Metrics Engine**:

* **Node Handshaking**: Uses **ETag** and **Cookie** identifiers to distinguish between **Unique** and **Returning** nodes without invasive tracking.
* **Edge Persistence**: Telemetry is processed via **Next.js Middleware** and stored in a global **Upstash Redis** instance for sub-10ms response times.

## ⚙️ The "Anti-Gravity" AI Workflow

This project is a showcase of **AI-Orchestrated Engineering**. The development cycle utilized a **Gemini/Antigravity workflow** to synthesize complex state management and Edge-logic while maintaining absolute code quality and system integrity.

---

## ⚖️ Privacy & Compliance Manifest
This laboratory is designed with a **Privacy-First Telemetry Architecture**.

* **No-PII Collection**: The system does not collect or store IP addresses, names, or geolocation data.
* **Functional Handshaking**: Persistent identifiers (ETags/Cookies) are utilized strictly for system-level node recognition to optimize Edge delivery and verify protocol state persistence.
* **Passive Telemetry**: Hardware info (Device type/OS) is captured solely for UI/UX responsiveness and is stored in an aggregated, non-traceable format in our Edge-database.
